The lunar lander simulation simulates the landing of a spacecraft on various planets. The name of this simulation originates from the fact that it is inspired from the 1979 lunar lander game. This simulation uses 2d kinematics and the gravitational force created due to the attraction of 2 masses as the main physics/math concepts. The user can experience these concepts by adjusting the spacecrafts thrust, orientation and descent rate to safely land while feeling the gravitational force of whatever chosen planet. The user can pause or reset the simulation at any time and chose another planet or resume the simulation. There is a variety of planets to chose from, each of which affects the ship differently. While experiencing the simulation, the user can see the magnitude of the graviational forvce acting on the space craft aswell as other pertinent information such as the velocities of the spacecraft.<br>

The color of the terrain changes based on what planet is selected. When the user presses the input key to make the ship thrust, the user can hear it and see fire coming out of the spacecraft.
